# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. The system uses a filtering process based on user preferences and browsing history to recommend movies that the user is likely to enjoy.

## Features

- **User Preferences**: Takes into account the user's ratings and preferences for various movies.
- **Browsing History**: Analyzes the user's browsing history to identify patterns and suggest similar movies.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses collaborative filtering techniques to find similarities between users and provide recommendations based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes movie content and recommends movies that share similar characteristics to the ones the user likes.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Collects data on user preferences and browsing history.
2. **Data Processing**: Processes the data to extract useful features for the recommendation algorithm.
3. **Model Training**: Trains a recommendation model using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Generates a list of recommended movies for the user based on the trained model.
